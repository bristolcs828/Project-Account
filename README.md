### [How to run this App](https://github.com/ccar728/uob-gruopProject/blob/main/STEP_TO_RUN.md)

This app is deployed locally, on [this](https://github.com/ccar728/uob-gruopProject/blob/main/STEP_TO_RUN.md) page we will list the steps required to run this app.

***Here a demonstration of the functionality of this app***ï¼š youtube page.......

### Product background and motication

From birth onwards, all processes of life have to deal with money, and most likely everyone's life goals are also linked to money, whether it is starting a family or career aspirations, which will eventually be measured in terms of money. When people are not clear about their goals and their current financial situation, they are prone to money anxiety, which is an instinctive anxiety about the unknown. Bookkeeping allows you to plan and sort out your financial situation, and you can clearly lay out on paper the flow of each of your miscellaneous income and expenditure. Through scientific planning and adjustment of spending, people can develop the habit of rational spending. This is why Money Cat is an app that allows users to keep track of all their spending.

Our goal is to achieve a healthy financial state. Pure, blind bookkeeping gives the user a low sense of achievement for the action of bookkeeping, which makes it difficult for the user to stick to it, and there is no way to talk about forming the habit of bookkeeping. Most of the bookkeeping apps on the market default to the user being a master of financial management, the interface and operation is too complex, which increases the learning cost and difficulty of some light bookkeeping users.

This is why Money Cat has designed a badge system, which is a reward mechanism that will increase the user's sense of achievement. Our app is a web-based bookkeeping app, with the core bookkeeping features of this kind of app, with customised tabs for adding, modifying and deleting, and users do not need to download the app, just need open it on their browser.



### The Users

When designing this software, our goal was to make every user financially sound, so that every user has a plan for their bookkeeping. All users of this software will be able to achieve a healthy financial status with the help of this software. There is no question of not being able to make ends meet.



### Overall design

The whole software from initial market research, team members brainstorming, designing the app, back-end code, front-end code.

During the market research phase, we investigated a large number of existing bookkeeping software in the market and analysed the [advantages and disadvantages](https://github.com/ccar728/uob-gruopProject/blob/main/good_n_bad.md), thus deciding that the goal of our software is to make users get used to and enjoy bookkeeping and achieve a healthy financial state by increasing their sense of achievement in bookkeeping.

The app has been designed with game elements to give users a sense of achievement in using it and thus develop a habit of bookkeeping. The app is designed with a medal system. The purpose of the badge system is to record the number of times a user has logged in. The first time a user logs in each day, they can check in and are given different badges according to the cumulative number of times they have checked in.

All steps of bookkeeping include: 

1. Start bookkeeping 
2. Enter amount 
3. Note information 
4. End

The notes for bookkeeping, entering the app, entering the amount and ending the bookkeeping are integral steps in the whole bookkeeping process, and the more detailed the notes, the longer the whole bookkeeping process will be. The act of bookkeeping is in itself a process of reviewing the user's financial situation, but if the user lacks conscious budgeting and bookkeeping behaviours, this is all tantamount to achieving an ultimately benign financial situation.

For this app, our process was to first use the React framework to complete the front-end part of the development, and use LocalStorage as temporary storage, then use nodejs with MongoDB database to implement the back-end development, and provide the login and registration functions.



### Work details

In what follows, we will cover all aspects of our process of analysing and developing this app, from how we conceptualised the project to designing the functionality to code development. In this section we will also evaluate each part of our project and how our team worked remotely due to the impact of the Covid-19.
