## Working practices

### General working practices

For this team project, we assigned 5 different positions to design and develop the project, so that everyone could give full play to his/her strengths in this project and present it as a whole.

In the beginning, we would ask everyone to express their own role in the team project, and let each member express their own ideas and rationalize the assignment of tasks. So in addition to the most efficient output each member can be knowledge, it is also very convenient for management, unified allocation as a result of the guarantee everyone's schedule, make the project in the later can be a perfect fit, such as the late finish the whole project, our thinking will be more clear, repetitive tasks will reduce a lot. 

Therefore, after we learned the overview of software tools, the use of Git and GitHub can help our team complete such a unification process very well. We set up several warehouses, and keep on the main branch, the member can access specific warehouse and file, and without the limitation of time and place, so the work time, each member has noninterference, members can improve the utilization rate of concentration and time, to ensure the normal operation of between all parts of the whole project.

### Management of issues

At the beginning, when I encountered such a task requiring multiple people to cooperate, I did encounter some problems, for example, many people were familiar with the same occupation and wanted to assume this position. After all, every member wants to maximize his value. Here is mainly about the position of the back end. 

In consideration of the development of the back end, our group discussed to divide the tasks of the back end into several small tasks. We want the overall project to have some characteristics, some unique and interesting elements, so we can collect more information of this kind, how to code the game elements or interesting interaction elements, to achieve good performance, which is very necessary for a project, no one likes to use a very rigid thing. Finally, after the implementation of the basic logic code, the implementation of interesting elements will be carried out. At this time, the programmer who checked more information and finished the docking is completed. Everything is more reasonable, and it can also well show the attraction of the project.

We arranged a lot of meetings for communication, and in every meeting, almost every valuable idea was put forward. In general, almost everyone can participate in the meeting at this time. There are 5 people working together on the project, and occasionally 4 people will discuss it, because if there is no procedural problem, we don't require programmers who are working on code tasks to attend. In the collaboration phase, the product planners and UX designers are primarily responsible for communicating project details.

### Evaluation of agile techniques 

In terms of technology assessment, the first thing that needs to be mentioned is the group working method of the iterative model. We mainly identified three directions of agile, which are as follows:

1.Profit. This allows you to consider each possible increase in stakeholder needs and make appropriate modifications.

2.Flexibility. When making relevant changes, it will not be too complicated, because each iteration model will ensure the certainty of ideas and reduce the negative impact caused by the final uncertainty

3.Efficiency. This group method can significantly reduce the cost of time loss caused by large changes in the later stage.

In addition, we set six ZOOM sprint meetings, each of which summarized the problems of the last meeting, and then arranged the tasks for everyone to perform in this meeting. When there were questions or uncertainties, we also consulted the professor and the teaching assistant to determine whether this idea was feasible in the team project.

## Project reflection

This project is a big challenge for every member of our team. Our project is an accounting application. At first, the usefulness of it is higher than its gameplay, we did not consider the reward system at the outset, without considering the realization of the game elements, after we finished the basic function of the project, we use the demo project and a professor in the school of computer and TA TA for communication, they put forward a proposal for strengthening project gameplay, The purpose of this advice is to make the project more interesting. So we designed more gamification elements to optimize the project. 


## Impact of COVID-19 on working practices

In general, this is a special year, because COVID-19 has hindered our cooperation, I mean we can't have heated discussion in a studio, we can only do it by remote, and some students are in China, no matter it is due to the network or the time difference. All of them had negative effects on the progress of the project more or less. Fortunately, all of them were actively faced with these problems, and every member was able to overcome the influence factors brought by the environment.

In addition, if we have problems that we can't solve, we will actively seek help. COVID-19 did not hinder the professor and TA from answering questions to us, and we can get a lot of suggestions from it to optimize our team project and make it more perfect.


## Discussion of Social and Ethical implications of our work

Our project can be understood as electronic accounting software. And each man as an individual life in society, and society can produce all kinds of contact, consumer behavior will actually and complex, and in addition to the accounting software, no one can be responsible for their behavior, especially a free of charge to an account software, the software itself is given priority to with easy operation and convenient, easy to operate features significantly expand the scope of application, For teenagers and middle-aged people, it's actually pretty easy to get used to most of the new software. But for very young children or the elderly, convenience is also an important advantage. Once people have the habit of keeping accounts, then he will certainly have a bigger picture of their investment and spending, more able to achieve reasonable management of their own funds, enhance financial awareness. Here are some important points to consider:

### 1. The project application needs to be accessible to as many people as possible

Initially, we designed this software for the majority of people. In fact, financial management is of great significance to people, so this bookkeeping application can help people develop this ability. We designed the app to be as simple and easy to use as possible, to make sure that no one who uses it finds it too complicated.

### 2. Reduce people's stress and anxiety

So far, the social development faster and faster, people are busy with their work, every time want to in such cases to record their own spending and consumption, it is very difficult, we hope we can make the project application of this matter become more simple, indirect every busy people to reduce their stress and anxiety.


## Future work（Design, development, evaluation） ## 

Design, development, evaluation. The project designed by my team is an accounting software. Considering that adding some game elements can improve the interest of the application, we set the interface of the accounting software application as Lucky Cat (as shown in the figure)：

</p>

The icon should reflect the accounting software use, is the financial management, to some extent, can directly affect the shopping needs of consumers, consumers in the accounting software, can according to their own have been spending much money in one aspect, to better arrange their own funds, reduce some unnecessary spending.

</p>

User can add his own EATING, SHOPPING, FRUIT, PARTY, ACCOMMODATE, TRAVEL, HEALTH, TRANSPORT, SPORT, PHONE, EDUCATE, and so on accounting requirements, covers most of the people daily needs, Can manage the expense of each part of the fund well, can clearly distinguish each part of the expense.

Accounting software as a convenient record and finishing of money software, using accounting software, can cultivate awareness of financial management, by adding interesting element, can make people more willing to use it, but not every time I use the eyes watching a very boring black and white and interface, it's no fun and interactivity and award system, It's hard for most people to get excited about it and stick with it.

</p>

The first value of accounting software is to cultivate people's financial awareness, imagine if a man doesn't record cash flow situation, he is often don't know if he is in a on the one hand, the cost is very high, far more than the other side, and if in the use of accounting software, then people will balance the subconscious mind spending and income situation of every part, Will meet each capital expenditure is within the scope of their funds.

Finally, the accounting software has the function of browsing history records. In the label of STATISTICS, everyone can review the details of each expenditure in the label established by himself and see the expenditure funds of multiple parts in the label.
