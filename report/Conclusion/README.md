## Working Practices ##

The cooperation project is very challenging. Different positions are assigned to each person, so that everyone can realize their own value in this cooperation project. At almost every ZOOM meeting, valuable ideas are presented. In general, almost everyone can participate in the meeting at this time. There are 5 people working together on the project, and occasionally 4 people will discuss it, because if there is no procedural problem, we don't require programmers who are working on code tasks to attend. In the collaboration phase, the product planners and UX designers are primarily responsible for communicating project details.

## Reflective Discussion of The Success of The Project

This project is very useful, in fact, its usefulness is far higher than its playability. After we completed the basic functions of the project, we communicated with TA with the project demo and the computer professor, and they put forward suggestions to strengthen the playability of the project, the purpose of which was to make the project more interesting. So we designed more gamification elements to optimize the project.

## Impact of COVID-19 on The Project

Have to say, this year is a special year, because of the effect of COVID - 19, the obstacles for our cooperation, we can only through the remote, and some classmates in the domestic, whether the network or the jet lag reason, more or less for the projects have a certain negative impact, but all of these can be overcome. The most important thing is that when we have some doubts about the project, we cannot directly communicate with the professor in time, which will undoubtedly affect the progress of our project.

## Discussion of Social and Ethical Implications

Our project can be understood as electronic accounting software. And each man as an individual life in society, and society can produce all kinds of contact, consumer behavior will actually and complex, and in addition to the accounting software, no one can be responsible for their behavior, especially a free of charge to an account software, the software itself is given priority to with easy operation and convenient, easy to operate features significantly expand the scope of application, For teenagers and middle-aged people, it's actually pretty easy to get used to most of the new software. But for very young children or the elderly, convenience is also an important advantage. Once people have the habit of keeping accounts, then he will certainly have a bigger picture of their investment and spending, more able to achieve reasonable management of their own funds, enhance financial awareness.

## Future Work（Design, Development, Evaluation） ## 

Design, development, evaluation. The project designed by my team is an accounting software. Considering that adding some game elements can improve the interest of the application, we set the interface of the accounting software application as Lucky Cat (as shown in the figure)：

Accounting software as a convenient record and finishing of money software, using accounting software, can cultivate awareness of financial management, by adding interesting element, can make people more willing to use it, but not every time I use the eyes watching a very boring black and white and interface, it's no fun and interactivity and award system, It's hard for most people to get excited about it and stick with it.

The first value of accounting software is to cultivate people's financial awareness, imagine if a man doesn't record cash flow situation, he is often don't know if he is in a on the one hand, the cost is very high, far more than the other side, and if in the use of accounting software, then people will balance the subconscious mind spending and income situation of every part, Will meet each capital expenditure is within the scope of their funds.
